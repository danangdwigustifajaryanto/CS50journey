## About
This repository documents my programming journey through the CS50 course. Here, you'll find a collection of code projects that I have created while following the course, each reflecting the skills and concepts I have learned throughout the course.

## Why I Took CS50
I decided to take the CS50 course for two reasons: firstly, for my own personal development and growth as a programmer, and secondly, to share my experiences with others. By following the course, I hope to deepen my understanding of programming fundamentals and gain the skills I need to create efficient and effective code. I believe that this course is an excellent opportunity to learn and grow as a programmer, and I am excited to share my knowledge and experiences with others who are passionate about programming.

## What You'll Find Here
This repository contains a collection of code projects that I have created while following the CS50 course, organized by week. Each project reflects the skills and concepts I have learned throughout the course, and I hope they serve as a source of inspiration for others who are learning to code.
